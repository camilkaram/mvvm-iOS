# mvvm-iOS
I created this repo to demonstrate MVVM advantages over MVC in iOS.

Note: the examples included are inspired from different implementations already available over the net. The main purpose of this repo is to provide some basic samples that others can rely on to start understanding how MVVM can be implemented in swift.
